## Quick Start (Colab)

1. Open any notebook below (once this repo is on GitHub) by replacing `SpaceTimeNarratives/spatio-textual-colab-demos` with your correct repo path:
   - [demo_1_entity_annotation.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SpaceTimeNarratives/spatio-textual-colab-demos/blob/main/demo_1_entity_annotation.ipynb)
      - Entity & verb annotation, sentence-safe chunking, and Qâ†”A-aware testimony segmentation.
   - [demo_2_sentiment_emotions.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SpaceTimeNarratives/spatio-textual-colab-demos/blob/main/demo_2_sentiment_emotions.ipynb)
      - Sentiment and emotion classification (rule backend) + hooks for HF/LLM.
   - [Interpretation: demo_4_interpretation.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SpaceTimeNarratives/spatio-textual-colab-demos/blob/main/demo_4_interpretation.ipynb)
      - Record-level summaries, affect explanations, simple themes (LLM-friendly).
   - [Visualisation: demo_5_visualisation.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SpaceTimeNarratives/spatio-textual-colab-demos/blob/main/demo_5_visualisation.ipynb)
      - GeoJSON export, Folium maps, and co-occurrence graphs.

2. In the first cell of each notebook, run the **Setup** cell to install dependencies.

3. Execute cells sequentially.

> Tip: If you are maintaining your own Python package repo for `spatio_textual`, add an install cell like `pip install git+https://github.com/<OWNER>/<PKG_REPO>.git@main` at the top of each notebook.

> ðŸ§© These notebooks assume you have access to the `spatio_textual` package (installed locally or available in your Colab environment).

## Notebooks

- `demo_1_entity_annotation.ipynb`  
  **Focus:** Entities, verbs, sentence-safe chunking, Qâ†”A testimony segmentation (`qa.py`).  
  **Input sample:** `data/testimonies/testimony_001.txt`, `data/testimonies/snippet_002.txt`.

- `demo_2_sentiment_emotions.ipynb`  
  **Focus:** Rule-based + hooks for HF/LLM; attach sentiment and emotion labels/scores to segments.

- `demo_3_interpretation.ipynb`  
  **Focus:** Summaries, affect explanations, theme tags; optional LLM hook.

- `demo_5_visualisation.ipynb`  
  **Focus:** GeoJSON export, Folium maps, co-occurrence graphs.

---

## Sample Data

Small testimony snippets are provided under `data/testimonies/` for quick runs. You can replace these with your own transcripts.

- `data/testimonies/testimony_001.txt`
- `data/testimonies/testimony_002.txt`

Each file uses a simple Qâ†”A prefixed format (e.g., `Q:` and `A:` lines), which the notebooks parse with `segment_testimony(...)`.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Colab says a spaCy model is missing.**  
A: Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` in the Setup cell.

**Q: I want faster execution.**  
A: Use `en_core_web_sm` for demos; switch to `en_core_web_trf` for higher quality (slower) runs.

**Q: I want to try Hugging Face models.**  
A: Uncomment the HF installs in the Setup cell and wire a `transformers` pipeline as shown in the sentiment notebook.

**Q: How do I keep pandas schema consistent?**  
A: Use `load_annotations(..., ensure_columns=True)` to add any missing columns.
